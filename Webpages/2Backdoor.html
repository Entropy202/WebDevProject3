                        You head round the back of the facility and surprisingly enough there was nobody around to stop you.<br>

                        <br> You make it to the back a find a door wide open, beckoning you to head inside - "this is going to be a breeze" you think to yourself.<br>

                        <br> You make it inside the building and notice a uniform that you could possibily use as a disguise to make your way through the facility
                        undetected. Alternativley, you have already noticed that this palce isn't so well guarded, maybe you can get away with just wondering around,
                        pretending that you belong there, I mean, you already made it inside, right?
