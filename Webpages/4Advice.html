                        There is no way you were thinking of calling your mother, right? Of course not - you call your agency.<br>

                        <br>You tell them of the situation you have found yourself in and where you are right now. They inform you
                        that they have been closely studiying the facility's blueprints further since you left for your mission. They advise
                        you that the best course of action would be to stand inside the toilet in the third cubicle and flush!<br>

                        <br> They claim that this will take you straight down to the sub-level that the device is being stored and tested on. There 
                        is no way that is true though, right? They must be having you on.<br>

                        You can either follow their advice OR attempt to grab that disguise you saw earlier and sneak your way down:
