                        Well done! You just grabbed it and walked off with it! People saw you doing it but they had never seen someone
                        With so much confidence before, they were hardly going to question you! They probably wanted you to think they
                        were cool.. <br>
                        
                        <br>You have just pulled off the most amazing (and most strangley performed) heist the world will ever know! You truly 
                        are deserving of this job - and nobody will remember the weird choices you made along the way (probably)
