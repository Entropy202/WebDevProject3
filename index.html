                        The aim of this project is to design and plan the creation and implementation of a website that exists 
                        to host a “Choose your Own Adventure” (CYOA) type game that provides an engaging and satisfying user 
                        experience to those who visit it. A CYOA game is a game wherein a story is told from a second-person 
                        point of view, where the reader assumes the role of the main character of the story. The reader is 
                        presented with multiple choices throughout the story where they make a decision that impacts where the
                        story takes them as well as the outcome of the tale, resulting in a unique experience (as well as being highly repayable).<br>
                        
                        <br>Classically, these types of games were presented through books, where the reader would be presented 
                        with a choice, flipping to whatever page instructed by the choice they make. Presenting this type 
                        of game using a website will modernise the user experience by attempting to immerse the user further 
                        through the use of the endless features of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <p style="padding-right: 30px;">
                        In the far future, a secret agency has successfully developed time travel technology. This technology is
                         far from perfect but is capable of transferring the user up to a few hours back in time. Despite this not
                          being a significant amount of time, this agency has been using it for significant purposes, doing what 
                          they can to see that mankind stays on the right path, secretly deploying their agents all over the world
                           to see that events go to plan, and if they don’t, to rewind and try again until they do.<br>

                        <br>In the story presented on this website, the user will play the role of one of these “Time Agents”. 
                        Their mission is to infiltrate a foreign research facility that is on the cusp of developing time travel
                         technology of their own. The Agency can see no good coming from this and has decided that an agent must
                          be deployed to ensure this progress is sabotaged completely.<br>

                        <br>The user will have to successfully infiltrated the research facility and find a way to sabotage 
                        the progress made on this technology - using only their wits and little bit of luck!
